# 📄 Resume Intake Agent

The **Resume Intake Agent** is responsible for extracting structured information from candidate resumes.  
It focuses on **resume parsing**, ensuring that **name, email, and raw content** are captured for downstream processing.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **PDF Parsing** – Reads resumes directly from uploaded PDF files.
